# Unity-1st-Game---EvadeTheCube
This project is a prototype akin to the mobile game Temple Run
You can play the game by right clicking "Evade the cube.exe" and clicking Save Link As which will download the game

Game Manual
Use the A and D or left and right arrow key to dodge the cubes
Red cubes causes damage, yellow cubes are considered coins.

This is a barebones game so I did not make a menu, high score system or pause menu. Look out for these features in my newer project
